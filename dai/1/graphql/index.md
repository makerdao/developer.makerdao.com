### GraphQL

_Status: prototype - not suitable for production use._

_This is an early prototype service which is intended to allow developers to experiment
with a GraphQL api, whilst informing development of our MCD production api, which is being
built with VulcanizeDB._

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those
queries. It provides a complete and understandable description of the
available data, and gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need
and nothing more.

##### Console

Explore the API via the interactive [in-browser IDE](https://graphql.makerdao.com/v1/console):

![]({{ "images/graphql.png" | relative_url }})

##### Query Endpoint

Interact with the API programatically via: [sai-mainnet.makerfoundation.com/v1](https://sai-mainnet.makerfoundation.com/v11)

```bash
$ curl -XPOST  \
       -H "Content-Type:application/graphql" \
       -d 'query { getCup(id: 100) { id lad } }' \
       https://sai-mainnet.makerfoundation.com/v1

  {
    "data": {
      "cup": {
        "id":100,
        "lad":"0xcE60Fa6BCb3Ba6FDE3d6b8196513458c00986E73"
      }
    }
  }
```
